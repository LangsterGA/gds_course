### To do before class

As a way to wet your apetite about the content of the first class, I recommend you:

* Listen to [this interview](http://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/solving-lifes-everyday-problems-with-data/) with Hilary Mason, Max Shron, and Alex Pentland about the power of data.

* Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1ImEQKSkUQ) by Mike Flowers, Chief Analytics Officer, at the City of New York about how data is used to influence policy decisions.

### Additional readings

The contents of this lecture are loosely based on, and explored into further detail, in the following three references :

* **[Recommended]** "Chapter 1: Introduction" {cite}`schutt2013doing`. Free sampler of the book containing the chapter available online ([html](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028529.do), [pdf](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/booksamplers/9781449358655_sampler.pdf)).
* Excellent overview of Data Science {cite}`donoho201750`.
* A Geographic take on Data Science, proposing a new field {cite}` singleton2019geographic`.

### Data

This session uses the **"Census socio-demographics"** datasets. Go to the [Datasets]() tab to find out more information as well as instructions to download it.

### Additional materials

* A good extension of this session is {cite}`Wickham:2014:JSSOBK:v59i10`. The paper is published under an Open Access license so it is freely available on the journal's site, but the author has also made available a public [repository](https://github.com/hadley/tidy-data) with the data and code used in the paper. Keep in mind the paper and the code that comes with it are based on R, not on Python.
* **[Visualization]** Python library `seaborn` [tutorial](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial.html).
* **[Recommended]** {cite}`mckinney2012python`: excellent introduction to Python for data analysis, with plenty of examples and code snippets (Publisher's page [link](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)).
* [NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html?_r=0) about the importance of cleaning data.
